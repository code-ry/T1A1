## Question 1

### *Identify and explain common and important components and concepts of web development markup languages*

### **Components**
Concept - A markup language is a type of encoding system in a text document in order for a computer to interpret the intended structure and formating to display. It is comprised of 2 part: the text to be displayed and the markup language on how to display it. Common languages are  (Standard Generalized Markup Language), HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), and XML (Extensible Markup Language). *(The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, markup  ,Encyclopaedia Britannica, viewed 29 Aug 2022, <https://www.britannica.com/technology/markup-language>.)*

Concept - Web development markup languages are **easy to learn** and use **common language** that is easy for anyone with basic computer literacy to understand, but also provides enough scope and flexibility when combined with other languages to be used by designers and professionals *(Grannell, C. (2007) The Essential Guide to CSS and HTML Web Design. P. 6 )*

The Document is divided up into sections called **Elements** which are denoted by symbols called **Tags** which are used for the computer browser to interpret in different ways. This can range from size or weight of font to heading and paragraphs. These interpretations conform to a standard laid out by the **World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)** to ensure compatability and consistency across browsers. For example a paragraph for a document in HTML is surrounded by angle brackets and the letter p \<p> to open and \</p> to end the section. <*(Grannell, C. (2007) The Essential Guide to CSS and HTML Web Design. P. 7 )*


**Nesting** of **tags** can be done by placing one inside another in order to apply multiple styles to an element for example you can make a text bold in HTML paragraph by **nesting** the **tag** \<strong>\</strong> inside.

**Semantic Markup** is used to establish accessibility and readability of the document. It defines the use of certain **tags** for defined areas of the document to be used for what they are originally designed for. This will result in cleaner code and adding presentation further down the line. For Example a \<nav> element defines its use for navigation bars. *(Grannell, C. (2007) The Essential Guide to CSS and HTML Web Design. P. 9 )*

Markup languages can be used for **structural** display of documents (HTML) as well as **visual** display of documents (CSS). This divides scope of the languages to provide cleaner documents and more efficient design. This decreased the size of one document and organises it so it can be worked on and upgraded easily. *(Grannell, C. (2007) The Essential Guide to CSS and HTML Web Design. P. 9 )*
